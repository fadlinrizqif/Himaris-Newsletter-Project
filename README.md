Himaris Newsletter is the result of our final project that is produced to fulfill the requirements of our Diploma III Programme of the English Department. Himaris Newsletter was develop by two person, Fadlin Rizqi Fadilah and Aquila Maha Fortuna and to develop the newsletter we are being supervise by our lecturer, Esti Sugiharti.

The content of newsletter have seven section such as,
* What's New?
* Inspirational Student and Alumni
* Self-Improvement
* Entertaiment
* Reviews
* Upcoming Events
* Job Vacancies


This newsletter was develop using the website called "Mailchimp", but it was difficult to show the product to public that not our subsciber. Unfortonately the newsletter can be seen to the Himaris member and alumni only. In order to show our product I created the newsletter from "mailchimp" to be a website itself so the people can seen our product.
